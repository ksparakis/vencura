# Dynamic‚Äôs Take Home (Backend)

Hello üëã

We at Dynamic are super passionate and excited about wallets [](https://www.dynamic.xyz/blog/the-wallet-wars-part-1)and their promise ([see our blog](https://www.dynamic.xyz/blog/the-wallet-wars-part-1)). 

One example is supporting the creation of non-custodial wallets for users who don‚Äôt have wallets yet and are starting their journey on Web3 ([see our blog](https://www.dynamic.xyz/blog/public-beta-release)).

In this exercise, you are going to build the Venmo of wallets. üí∞¬†¬†We call it ‚ÄúVenCura‚Äù 

<aside>
ü§Ø Thank you GPT ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ÄúThe name combines the words "Venmo" and "Custodian" to create a unique name that suggests a safe and reliable financial service.  "Cura" means "care" or "guardianship" in Latin, which fits with the idea of a custodian service.‚Äù

</aside>

In this take-home, you will build an API platform (with a basic UI) to generate custodial wallets on the backend with support for basic actions.  We leave it kinda open-ended to not limit your creativity and to let you focus on things that you are interested in, within this problem.

### Requirements:

- An authenticated user can create at least one account/wallet.
- All the interactions with the custodial wallet would be done on the backend via an API.
- A user can perform at least these actions on the wallet:
    - getBalance() ‚Üí  balance: number (get the current balance on the wallet.
    - signMessage(msg: string) ‚Üí signedMessage: string (The signed message with the private key)
    - sendTransaction(to: string, amount: number) ‚Üí transactionHash: string (sends a transaction on the blockchain)
- Basic UI to interact with the API.
- We encourage you to use the language/framework that you‚Äôre most comfortable with as long as it is a language we are familiar with (Javascript/Typescript, Ruby, Python, Java, and Scala). Internally, we use TypeScript, Node and React, but our core product needs to work seamlessly with many different build tools and frameworks.

### What to focus on:

- Code + API + Schema design and implementation.
- Security considerations (could be in a writeup).
- Testing.

### UI:

The main focus of this takehome is the API/Backend experience. The UI should allow you to showcase the functionality that you built on the backend.

### S**ome cool o**ptional **ideas that you add:**

- Users can have many accounts
- Account from the same user can interact with each other (think saving/checking account)
- Invite users to share access to the same wallet
- Show transaction history (on/off-chain)
- Incorporate messaging platform (XMTP)
- Make it secured
- Make it non-custodial

### Tips (you don‚Äôt have to follow any of them):

- You can use Dynamic for the authentication layer.
- You can use any open source library for managing the wallet interactions on the backend, such as [Ethers](https://www.dynamic.xyz/blog/how-does-ethers-js-work) or [Viem](https://viem.sh/)
    - Ethers has a [Wallet](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/api/wallet/#about-wallets) class that handles the private key and common methods
- You can use these faucets to get some free  [sepolia](https://sepoliafaucet.com/) (assuming that you are building it on Ethereum)
- Here are two RPC [infura](https://app.infura.io/) end-points for ETH testnets that you can use:
    - Seopolia - https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/91de7ed3c17344cc95f8ea31bf6b3adf

### Duration

We know life is busy and we want to give you space to do your best work.  We are flexible, please just let us know when you will be expecting to submit the task. 

### How to submit:

When you‚Äôre ready, send us a link to a GitHub repository and to a deployed environment.

Please include notes about your architecture decisions, weaknesses, any concerns (if any) that you have with the implementation.

### Next Steps:

**Technical:**

- Once you submit the take home, we will review it and schedule some time to review your implementation with the team
- There will be one more technical interview where you will discuss in detail a past project that you worked on.

**Non-Technical:**

- Interviews with Itai (CEO) and product.
- [Optional] We will give you the option to talk to anyone else on the team, as you are interviewing us as well.

Have Fun, and we are looking forward to reviewing your submission and chatting more!
